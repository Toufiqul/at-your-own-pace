## Mission and Objectives
Our mission is to make NASA’s PACE data accessible to all, starting from zero knowledge, and transform users into PACE champions. We provide tailored educational resources and foster a community that promotes global ocean literacy.

## How We Addressed the Challenge
We tackled the challenge by developing the following features:

1. **Simplified Data Access**: Users can download PACE satellite data easily through an integrated NASA API, reducing complexity and technical barriers.
2. **Ready-made Visualizations**: Pre-made, classroom-ready visualizations of PACE data help teachers present complex information in an easy-to-understand format.
3. **Kid-Friendly Resources**: Comics, videos, and story maps tailored for different student grade levels, making learning about PACE engaging and accessible.
4. **AI Chatbot**: A custom chatbot trained on PACE data that assists educators with lesson plans and answers questions.
5. **Global Community**: A collaborative platform for educators to share resources, showcase their work, and earn the title of "PACE Champion" through gamified activities.

## Collaboration and Future Goals
We are actively collaborating with institutions like **Noazesh Knowledge Center** and are exploring further partnerships to expand our reach. Future developments will include more interactive features like quizzes, 3D maps, and virtual reality field trips using real-time PACE data.
